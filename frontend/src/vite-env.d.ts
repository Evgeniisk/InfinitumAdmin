/// <reference types="vite/client" />
// This line tells TypeScript to include type declarations from Vite's client-side environment.
// It enables proper typing for Vite-specific features like import.meta, environment variables (e.g., import.meta.env), and module imports (like importing images, CSS).

//This file is used to inform TypeScript about Vite's global types, ensuring your development environment understands Vite-specific syntax and helpers. It's a standard part of any TypeScript + Vite setup.
